/**
   This class implements a tail of length n which may be attached to a
   particle. We maintain a list of points - the path of the particle
   over the last n ticks. We join the dots to draw the tail. Perhaps
   not all the dots...

   <pre>

   A tail that joins every other dot:

             +--+  +--+  +--+>>
	     tail            particle

   </pre>

   The alogorithm is not perfect. If the frame rate gets higher the tail
   will shorten because the distance travelled each tick will be
   less. Oh well !

   ? Design ? Should Tail extend Obj3d or have an Obj3d ?(cf a cloud
   has an Obj3d)
