   This class implements a thermal trigger. Every cycle the trigger
   releases a bubble of warm air that floats up to produce a
   cloud. Well, that is the impression we hopefully evoke.

   The trigger model contains lots of dubious assumptions and gross
   simplifacations. Good !

   We add a veneer of noise to the otherwise clockwork like behaviour
   of the trigger without departing from the deterministic model.
