Thermals
--------
Cumulus clouds are fed by bubbles of warm rising air, called thermals. By using thermals, glider pilots are able to fly long distances. When you fly into a thermal you should circle to stay in the lift and climb up to cloud base.

Your vario will start beeping when you are in a thermal. <!--- The higher pitch the beep is, the better *(faster)* the lift is.  -->

Ridge Lift
----------
*Note: There may not be any hills in the default task map for v3.02x*
Hills produce lift as the wind flows over them. A glider may ridge soar by flying back and forth in the rising air in front of the hill.

Glider pilots also like hills because they function as reliable thermal triggers.

Your mission
------------
*Note: This is from v3.01 and is outdated.  Update soon...*
Race against the other gliders; the finish line is 100 km away to the north.

A note on navigation: To find the finish line, simply follow the road that runs north. You have a compass at the bottom right.

Points of View
--------------
*Note: These are from v3.01 and are outdated.  Update soon...*
Drag the mouse to rotate the camera position. You may switch between points of view using the number keys...

 - `1` focus on your glider
 - `2` watch the gaggle
 - `3` the view from 5,000 meters above
 - `4` the view from 8 km away to the south east 

Try pressing `p` to pause the action and then switch between the different points of view.

Dragging the mouse whilst the action is paused gives a cool 'bullet time' effect. 
<!--- give specifics as to what the camera does based on which direction you drag the mouse -->
<!---
1 you (pilot #1)
2 cycle through views of the other pilots (generally progress 2-10 but not sequentially... proximity-based? look at what happens in the code when you press '2'...)
3 "plan"
4 "far out"
5 "task map"
6 "eagle eyes" (as if you were inside your glider -- but no banking)
7 "stay there" (freeze camera view)

Controls
--------
*Note: These are from v3.01 and are outdated.  Update soon...*
 - `y`       : Launch start
 - `1,2,3,4` : Change camera perspective *(see above section)*
 - `z`       : Turn left
 - `x`       : Turn right
 - `Spacebar`: Circle (in thermal)
 - `p`       : Pause/Resume
 - `a`       : Normal/Fast glide
 - `q`       : Fast simulation on/off
 
 *Left and Right arrow keys have replaced `z` & `x` in v3.02x*
 *Spacebar and `p` works in v3.02x; `a`, `q` may not*
