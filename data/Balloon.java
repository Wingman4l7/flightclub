/**
   This class outputs a text file of data for a balloon. See
   GliderType for a definition of the file format. The file
   balloon.txt is output to the current directory.

   This is a hack - a balloon is not really a glidertype, but this
   sort of works - see the glidertypes test harness. 

   The polar does not apply for a balloon. We fudge it by setting a
   very low speed and zero sink. Any sink in the polar makes the
   balloon pitch. We do not want that !
